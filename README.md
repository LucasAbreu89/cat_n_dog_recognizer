const readmeContent = `# Cat or Dog Recognizer

This is a simple web application built with Streamlit that can classify uploaded images as either a cat or a dog using the MobileNetV2 model and the Annoy library.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

\`\`\`shell
git clone <repository-url>
\`\`\`

2. Install the required dependencies:

\`\`\`shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
\`\`\`

3. Run the application:

\`\`\`shell
streamlit run app.py
\`\`\`

Make sure you have Python and pip installed on your machine.

## Usage

1. Access the web application by visiting the provided local URL (usually http://localhost:8501) in your web browser.

2. Click on the "Choose an image..." button to upload an image (supported formats: JPG and PNG).

3. Wait for the application to analyze the image.

4. The application will display the uploaded image and provide the classification result as either a cat or a dog. If the classification result is inconclusive, it will indicate uncertainty.

## Customization

- You can customize the distance threshold for classification by modifying the \`distanceThreshold\` variable in the \`app.ts\` file.

- To use your own image datasets for training the models, replace the \`cat_images\` and \`dog_images\` folders with your own image folders and retrain the models accordingly.
